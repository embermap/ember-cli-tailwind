| Here you can specify the colors used in your project. To get you started,
| we've provided a generous palette of great looking colors that are perfect
| for prototyping, but don't hesitate to change them for your project. You
| own these colors, nothing will break if you change everything about them.
|
| We've used literal color names ("red", "blue", etc.) for the default
| palette, but if you'd rather use functional names like "primary" and
| "secondary", or even a numeric scale like "100" and "200", go for it.
